           <b> Tomorrow’s Workplace </b><br><br>
    The employees of the world have cast their votes. The ability to tailor one’s workday, virtual learning for kids, proximity to home, the luxury of home-cooked meals, and zero travel softened the pandemic fatigue when trying to balance a full-time job and the demands of family life. Liberated from long commutes to the office and greater flexibility in balancing personal and professional lives, employees are now wanting to stay at home for work and would rather not revert to the pre-pandemic ways of mandatory attendance in the office.

    <p style="font-size: x-small; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;"> A recent PwC survey offers validation. The survey found that over 55% of US employees would prefer to work from home at least three days a week once pandemic concerns recede. Over 34% of employees say their productivity increased while working from home. Company leaders 
        agree. The forced experiment around remote working has shattered the inhibition organization leaders had about implementing a remote or a hybrid workplace. According to a survey of 800 employers by Mercer, an HR and workplace benefits consulting firm, 94% of companies have seen productivity levels rise since remote working became a norm. 
  This shift to a hybrid workforce presents organizations with a unique opportunity to reshape the work landscape of tomorrow. We are at a point of inflection and the course we decide upon will have a long-standing impact on a company’s ability to attract the right talent at an optimized cost. Competition for talent was fierce even before the pandemic hit given the rapidly changing technology landscape in which today’s in demand skills can be obsolete by tomorrow. At the same time, the benefits of remote working have made a large portion of this talent pool unwilling to relocate to the employers’ location or commute to the office. Matching talent with the job requirement in this scenario becomes even more challenging, much like trying to hit a moving target. </p>
