       <b>The Pivot to ‘Experience’</b> <br><br>
hree key factors are primarily responsible for the focus on experience: <br><br>

 <b>Consumerization of experience: </b> <br><br>

 One key factor has been the influence individuals have seen as consumers – the enterprise customer is also a consumer. As a consumer, the advent of mobile apps, digitization, and AI, have radically changed experiences across the cycle, from propensity to buy, to purchase and post-purchase. Transactional simplicity, speed of use and responsiveness have dramatically changed over the last few years. Further, the advent of social media has changed how brands drive communication to consumers. This consumerization of experience begs one question – why is my experience as a consumer not the same as an enterprise customer? 
   <p style="font-size: x-small; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">
  <b>Defining Experience  </b><br><br>
 How do you define “experience”? The prompt answer is customer experience (CX), or employee experience (EX), and to a lesser extent supplier experience from a functional standpoint, or more generically, as user experience (UX). 
 Let’s take customer experience to delve in a bit deeper. Historically, companies have invested in customer experience, but more so as part of a product, or a services sales cycle. These are then monitored using post-sales surveys. But this approach does little justice to the end-to-end process the customer has gone through and may result in point-of-time feedback coupled with the potential for recency bias. 
     
     To tackle this loophole, companies have adopted a more end-to-end approach by keeping customer journeys and touchpoints as key milestones. There are “moments that matter,” and to identify these moments requires skills beyond process domain, lean/six sigma, and other technology training. </p>

            <b> Experience as a Competitive Advantage</b> <br><br>
It is important to call out how experience specifically enhances the digital advantage. Organizations that embrace digital solutions clearly have a competitive advantage in three key areas: 

    <b>Agility/faster time to market:</b> <br><br>
 Insights from market and customer data are leveraged to make decisions faster. The ability to test new products/services with rapid A/B testing and make changes in near real-time is a key advantage. 

    <b>Efficiency:</b> <br><br>
 Digital technologies streamline operations and automate manual processes, resulting in greater speed, less waste, and more focus on core activities.
