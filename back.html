    <b style="font-size: x-small;  margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Invest in Yourself</b>

    <p  style="font-size: x-small; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">While on a career break, push yourself to keep up the learning curve. Refresh and update your skills or learn a whole new skillset. Don’t lose track of what’s happening in your industry. Find good online training modules to earn certifications. Keeping your skills up to date will help you stay relevant in the market even after a break. The need becomes even more crucial when a career break lasts for years, which can glaringly widen the gap between your capabilities and the skills currently in demand. <br>
            
            <br><br>
           <b> Keep networking and stay updated</b><br>
           <br>
            Stay connected and involved with your career networks, your colleagues, and managers. Meet new people, attend webinars, and stay abreast with the opinions of the industry peers and experts. Network informally with potential recruiters about changing parameters of hiring. Update your resume to reflect the career break. You can also add a cover letter that offers more information on your reasons for the break. Use the opportunity to highlight the time you have spent honing your skills during the break.
          <br><br><br>
            <b>Prepare your interview responses </b> <br><br>
            Being away from the corporate world could have blunted those quick instincts. Prepare yourself. Prepare to answer questions about your break without any guilt or regret. Be honest and confident. If possible, offer ways it can help in your future role.
            <br> <br><br>
            
           <b> Build a support system </b><br><br>
            Having a supportive spouse and a family, undoubtedly plays a huge part in facilitating men and women to make a successful comeback to the workforce. Make sure your support system rallies around you and understands what are the specific areas that they need to help with. It could be grandparents sharing school drops and picks of children, either of the spouses helping kids with homework, or hiring a house-help to take care of chores. Just don’t shy away from asking for help.
            
            As businesses recalibrate their talent-hiring strategies and facilitate the development of relevant infrastructure for the ease of re-hired employees, it is time career-breaks transform into a time for proactive upskilling. Bringing back the dropped-off workforce, after all, is a two-way process.
