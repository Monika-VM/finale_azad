       <b style="font-size: x-small;">True success has more to do with how ‘happy you are when you are alive’ than ‘how much money you left behind’ </b><br><br>
       
       Kevin works at a reputable organisation and earns a handsome living, his bosses love him, and are always citing him as a model employee to the newcomers. Some would call him successful. But does Kevin think so?
       <br><br>
       An idea so abstract that pinning down a particular definition of success is near impossible. To each their own. It is, however, the most sought-after aspiration for everyone, no doubt. Be it an employee or an entrepreneur, who doesn’t want the taste of success?
       <br><br>
       But with the work-life balance coming under the scanner during the recent and ongoing pandemic, the individual ideas of measuring success have also been honed under pressure. Fat paychecks, high-performing bonuses, or the lure of plush cabins are no longer the perks the talent pool is solely interested in. While fair compensation is non-debatable, today’s workforce is seeking much more in terms of job satisfaction, meaningful contribution to work and society, and personal life gratification. The question now begs – what must the corporate world, driven primarily by revenues, must do to balance it out with the new age ideas of success?

      <b>Mind over Matter</b> <br><br>
       To be successful at work, employees maximise their efforts in a constant endeavour to get the best performance reviews, ensuring they are not left behind in the rat race. As individuals, we have always learned that the more money you have, the more successful you are considered, and hence we spend our lives chasing salary hikes, incentives, or promotions.
       <br><br>
       If the power of money was so encompassing, why is the wave of ‘The Great Resignation’ engulfing the corporate reality today? Even with higher salaries than usual, greater opportunity across domains, and the promise of financial perks, employers are still finding it a task to retain talent. The workforce that has tasted the possibilities of working from home or anywhere is actively exploring avenues beyond monetary rewards to prioritise their comfort, mental health, and happiness. As hustle culture takes a backseat, both corporate and employees need to deliberate on the new meaning of success in today’s world.
