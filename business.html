     <b>Please elaborate on the work done at your delivery center and its history?</b><br><br>
The Netherlands started in 2012 with opening a DC in Eindhoven as part of a rebadged deal. This was complemented in 2015 with a similar deal with a local pension & insurance service provider. We deliver Finance & Accounting, Insurance & Pensions processes, with 209 colleagues.
<br><br>
    <b>How has your experience?</b><br><br>
Over the last 8 years, I have been on a roller-coaster journey with a lot of ups and downs but it has been a positive experience overall. I've had lots of opportunities to learn and gain experience. I believe that whatever success I have attained is through hard work and patience.
<br><br>
    <b>What is your favorite part of work?</b><br><br>
Managing people, meeting new people and having the ability to keep on innovating.
<br><br>
    <b>How would you describe the overall employee profile/ diversity in your delivery centre?</b><br><br>
The team comprises of 90% Dutch and the country normally turns "ORANGE" every game with a very disappointing exception this year because our team didn't qualify for this year's World Cup.
<br><br>
    <b>Which country is most likely to win this year's football world cup and why?</b><br><br>
    Spain, because they have outstanding players and as a team, they are quite a threat for other teams.
    <br><br>
        <b>What's your favorite memory with respect to the football world cup?</b><br><br>
    2014 - Netherland 5 - Spain 1
    <br><br>
        <b>Please share some thoughts on your country's footballing culture.</b><br><br>
    5 million people out of a total population of 16 million play the game at 35,000 registered football clubs. When it comes to football the Dutch are on par with the best countries in the worlds.
